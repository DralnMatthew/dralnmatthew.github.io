                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Atmospheric new-particle formation (NPF) plays a crucial role in generating climate-influencing aerosol particles. Direct observation of NPF is achievable by tracking the evolution of aerosol particle size distributions in the environment. Such analysis allows researchers to determine the occurrence of NPF on specific days. Currently, the most dependable method for categorizing days into NPF event (class Ia, class Ib, class II) or non-event categories relies on manual visual analysis. However, this manual process is labor-intensive and subjective, particularly with long- term data series. These issues underscore the need for an automated classification system to classify these days more objectively.
                    <br>
                    This research introduces feature-engineering based machine learning classifiers to discern NPF event and non-event days at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland. The classification utilizes a suite of informative features derived from the multi-modal log-normal distribution fitted to the aerosol particle concentration data and time series analysis at various scales. The proposed machine learning classifiers can achieve an accuracy of more than 90% in identifying NPF event and non-event days. Moreover, they are able to reach an accuracy of around 80% in further categorizing days into detailed subcategories including class Ia, class Ib, class II, and non-event. Notably, the machine learning classifiers reliably predict all event Ia days where particle growth and formation rates are confidently measurable. Moreover, a comparative analysis is conducted between feature-engineering machine learning methods and image-based deep learning in terms of time efficiency and overall performance. The conclusion drawn is that through reasonable feature engineering, machine learning methods can match or even surpass deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios where time efficiency is paramount. The results of this study strongly support further investigation into this area to improve our knowledge and proficiency in automating New Particle Formation (NPF) event detection.

                    In our approach to analyzing New Particle Formation (NPF) events, we focus on measurements collected exclusively during daylight hours based on the understanding that NPF
                    mostly happens in the daytime. This targeted data selection makes sure that the
                    dataset captures the most relevant atmospheric conditions conducive to NPF events and
                    further enhances the predictive accuracy of our models.

                    For our purposes, AlexNet couldn’t identify NPF events without adjustments because the
                    original model does not have understanding of the relevant NPF shapes. In this way,
                    we make some customization to handle other image types and adopt a transfer-learning
                    approach to retrain it for analyzing PSD images. Through modifying the final layers of
                    AlexNet, we can adapt the network with fewer images than its initial training required.
                    This efficient method employs the layered structure of CNNs: early layers extract
                    complex features into more manageable abstractions, while the adjusted final layers are
                    fine-tuned to predict specific classes.

                    It is generally straightforward for humans to discern the occurrence of NPF events in
                    graphical plots or to identify objects, such as cats, in digital images. This insight led us
                    to imagine banana-shaped NPF events as distinct objects, suggesting that object detection methods used in digital image
                    analysis could also be adapted to detect these specific NPF patterns. In this way, our
                    approach utilizes a deep learning technique known as Mask R-CNN, which is an instance
                    segmentation method proven effective in localizing objects within images. This
                    model is particularly adept at delineating the spatial contours of objects, hence it’s employed to accurately outline the banana-shaped configuration of NPF events. Essentially,
                    this method allows us to directly target the visual markers of NPF occurrences, and thus
                    provides a novel solution to classifying these events
